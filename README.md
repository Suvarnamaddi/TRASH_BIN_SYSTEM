# TRASH_BIN_SYSTEM
This is a C-based console application that simulates a simple trash bin system. It allows users to view files, delete (soft delete) files by moving them to a trash list, and restore them later. File handling is used for data persistence through files.txt and trash.txt. Simple menu-driven interface.
